\noindent Dear Hiring Manager,\\
 
I am a software engineer with more than 4 years of experience in software development and a Master's degree in Computer Science from University at Buffalo.\\

During my experience at Cox Automotive Inc (Dealer.com), I was part of the team that handles architecture design for the entire web platform. I, along with my team, revamped the entire web platform at DDC, which gave me a lot of experience in building scalable software from ground up. I also understood the importance of monitoring and architecting stable systems.I was working on something new and exciting most of the time,given the size of the codebase, for which I had to quickly assimilate domain knowledge, learn new technologies and apply them to solve some complex problems. My  experience so far has instilled in me the confidence to attack or approach any problem without any apprehension or fear of failure.\\
 
I bring with me, a passion and commitment to work and a plethora of technical skills. Given the opportunity, I assure you that my expertise combined with my motivation and enthusiasm will make me an asset to your organization. I would love to meet with you and discuss further about this position and my background.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.\\
 
\noindent Sincerely,\\
Srinivasa Sai Kaushal Bondada\\
